# Dataset of Electrochemical window for metal contained solid-state electrolytes

In our work of [Design principle for anode stable solid-state electrolytes](Available after publication), we examined the reduction
voltage for 16,644 typical metal contained solid state electrolyte with Li(Na) disordered rocksalt structure (DRX), Li(Na) Perovskite 
(PRX) as well as Li(Na) metal halides. 

## Json files
All computed reduction/oxidation limit as well as reduction products are made availble through json files.
* `Li-DRX.json`: Electrochemical stability for Li disordered rocksalt.
* `Na-DRX.json`: Electrochemical stability for Na disordered rocksalt.
* `Li-PRX.json`: Electrochemical stability for Li perovskite.
* `Na-PRX.json`: Electrochemical stability for Na perovskite.
* `Li-MH.json`: Electrochemical stability for Li metal halides.
* `Na-MH.json`: Electrochemical stability for Na metal halides.
